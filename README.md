# PyGeoTogether
_Python API client for GeoTogether devices._

## History
This code is based on the Python-OpenHAB code from [owainlloyd](https://github.com/owainlloyd/Geohome_Integration) and builds on it to allow historic usage data to be retrieved as well as live and periodic.

It is my first foray in to Python and whilst I have tried to follow best practices I've no-doubt made plenty of mistakes, for which I can only apologise.
